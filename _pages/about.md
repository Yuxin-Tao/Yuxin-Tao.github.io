Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Center for Statistical Science](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Dong Li](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/teachers/李东/). Currently, I am visiting the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/home) at Harvard University for one year, and I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Zheng (Tracy) Ke](http://zke.fas.harvard.edu/index.html).

My primary research interests lies in the field of financial econometrics, non-linear time series modeling, network analysis and topic modeling. Moreover, I have a broad interest in exploring the interactions of statistics with various disciplines, and considering ways in which statisticians can better contribute to the broader scientific community.

Beyond academics, I love music, movies, and travelling.
