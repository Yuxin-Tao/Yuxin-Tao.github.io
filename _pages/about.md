Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Center for Statistical Science, Tsinghua University, and I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Dong Li. Currently, I am visiting the Department of Statistics at Harvard University for one year, and I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor Zheng (Tracy) Ke. In 2019, I obtained my B.A. degree in Foreign Languages and B.E. degree in Economics from Tsinghua University.

My primary research interests lies in the field of financial econometrics, non-linear time series modeling, network analysis and topic modeling. Moreover, I have a broad interest in exploring the interactions of statistics with various disciplines, and considering ways in which statisticians can better contribute to the broader scientific community. Beyond academics, I love music, movies, photography and travelling.
